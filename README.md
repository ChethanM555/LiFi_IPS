# LiFi_IPS
Python codes for Indoor positioning using LiFi
So basically ips_gen.py generates intensity value based on x, y, z coordinates and alpha and beta values.
alpha is the distance of x-axis of x-axis sensor from origin and beta is the distance of y-axis of y-axis sensor from the origin.
The equation solver suffers errors due to round off error.
